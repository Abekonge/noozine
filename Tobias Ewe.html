<br>
We finally moved!
<br>
As I wrote last week, we're leaving our apartment in the Copenhagen commune and starting our trip to the new biome in Essen. I've never been, but it just sounds like such a great place to be right now. People call it the centre of Europe, but I do have my doubts.
<br><br>
Anyway, I found an old list I made back in the 21st century. I guess I was really into the future back then.
<br><br><br>
<b><u>2121</u></b><br>
<i>Existence <b>will not</b> be easy.<br>
Computers <b>will not</b> save us.<br>
AI will <b>will not</b> exist - they will take offense to you calling them "artificial."<br>
Interfaces <b>will not</b> be "experiences."<br>
Users <b>will not</b> be "people."<br>
Power structures <b>will not</b> dissolve. Unless you make them.<br>
We <b>will not</b> live on Mars.<br>
Global warming <b>will not</b> have ended. It will have transformed.<br>
You <b>will not</b> own a (self-driving) car<br>
<br>
Capitalism <b>might</b> crumble.<br>
Europe <b>might</b> still exist. USA will not.<br>
Suburbs <b>might</b> be eradicated in favour of sustainable urban living.<br>
You <b>might</b> live in Africa (if you can afford it).<br>
You <b>might not</b> have money for a computer, but you know how to build one.<br>
Money <b>might</b> still exist...<br>
<br>
Science <b>will</b> be poetic again.<br>
You <b>will</b> ride your bicycle.<br>
Neoliberalism <b>will</b> fall.<br>
Freedom of sexuality <b>will</b> be a given. Gender equality will not.<br>
You <b>will</b> create art.<br>
You <b>will</b> go to work.<br>
You <b>will</b> still hate your job.<br>
We <b>will</b> decide together.<br>
We <b>will</b> live together.<br></i>
<br><br><br>

As you see, it was a while ago. I mean, I definitely got a lot of that wrong. Still, it's pretty interesting to see how hopeful I was back then.
